This is the implemented task :) 

Layers of gases are given, with certain type (ozone, oxygen, carbon dioxide) and thickness, 
affected by atmospheric variables (thunderstorm, sunshine, other effects). When a part of one 
layer changes into another layer due to an atmospheric variable, the newly transformed layer 
ascends and engrosses the first identical type of layer of gases over it. In case there is no identical 
layer above, it creates a new layer on the top of the atmosphere. In the following we declare, how 
the different types of layers react to the different variables by changing their type and thickness.  

No layer can have a thickness less than 0.5 km, unless it ascends to the identical-type upper layer. In 
case there is no identical one, the layer perishes. 
The program should continue the simulation until one gas component totally perishes 
from the atmosphere. The program should print all attributes of the layers by simulation 
rounds!
